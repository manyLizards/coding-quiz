A less than fruitful effort made by me. As it is the due date I will turn it in as is to work on my next project, and accept the low grade (for now.) If I find time within the bootcamp, I will return to this project with a different mindset since I now see the importance and usefulness of arrays to shuffle through the questions rather than having to write a different class for every stinking answer. It was very time consuming and I should never have gone back to it. Hopefully I'll find the time to revamp this challenge before the bootcamp is over.
